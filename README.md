# Git Commit Conventions

See how [a minor change](#examples) to your commit message style can make a difference. 

## Commit Message Formats

### Default
<pre>
<b><a href="#types">&lt;type&gt;</a></b></font>(<b><a href="#scopes">&lt;optional scope&gt;</a></b>): <b><a href="#description">&lt;description&gt;</a></b>
<sub>empty separator line</sub>
<b><a href="#body">&lt;optional body&gt;</a></b>
<sub>empty separator line</sub>
<b><a href="#footer">&lt;optional footer&gt;</a></b>
</pre>

### Merge Commit
<pre>
Merge branch '<b>&lt;branch name&gt;</b>'
</pre>
<sup>Follows default git merge message</sup>

### Revert Commit
<pre>
Revert "<b>&lt;reverted commit subject line&gt;</b>"
</pre>
<sup>Follows default git revert message</sup>

### Inital Commit 
```
chore: init
```

### Types
* API relevant changes
    * `feat` Commits, that adds or remove a new feature
    * `fix` Commits, that fixes a bug
* `refactor` Commits, that rewrite/restructure your code, however does not change any API behaviour
    * `perf` Commits are special `refactor` commits, that improve performance
* `style` Commits, that do not affect the meaning (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
* `test` Commits, that add missing tests or correcting existing tests
* `docs` Commits, that affect documentation only
* `build` Commits, that affect build components like build tool, ci pipeline, dependencies, project version, ...
* `ops` Commits, that affect operational components like infrastructure, deployment, backup, recovery, ...
* `chore` Miscellaneous commits e.g. modifying `.gitignore`

### Scopes
The `scope` provides additional contextual information.
* Is an **optional** part of the format
* Allowed Scopes depends on the specific project
* Don't use issue identifiers as scopes

### Breaking Changes Indicator
Breaking changes should be indicated by an `!` before the `:` in the subject line e.g. `feat(api)!: remove status endpoint`
* Is an **optional** part of the format

### Description
The `description` contains a concise description of the change.
* Is a **mandatory** part of the format
* Use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
  * Think of `This commit will...` or `This commit should...`
* Don't capitalize the first letter
* No dot (`.`) at the end

### Body
The `body` should include the motivation for the change and contrast this with previous behavior.
* Is an **optional** part of the format
* Use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
* This is the place to mention issue identifiers and their relations

### Footer
The `footer` should contain any information about **Breaking Changes** and is also the place to **reference Issues** that this commit refers to.
* Is an **optional** part of the format
* **optionally** reference an issue by its id.
* **Breaking Changes** should start with the word `BREAKING CHANGES:` followed by space or two newlines. The rest of the commit message is then used for this.


### Examples
* ```
  feat: add email notifications on new direct messages
  ```
* ```
  feat(user profile): add updating button
  ```
* ```
  feat!: add background worker for email verification
  ```
* ```
  fix(api): handle empty message in request body
  ```
* ```
  fix(api): fix wrong calculation of request body checksum
  ```
* ```
  fix: add missing parameter to get deposit request
  ```
* ```
  perf: decrease memory reallocation by using sync.pool
  ```
* ```
  build: update dependencies
  ```
* ```
  build(release): bump version to 1.0.0
  ```
* ```
  refactor: implement fibonacci number calculation as recursion
  ```
* ```
  style: optimize import statement
  ```

## Git Hook Scripts to ensure commit message header format
<details>
<summary>Click to expand</summary>
   
### commit-msg Hook (local)
* Create a commit-msg hook using [git-conventional-commits cli](https://github.com/qoomon/git-conventional-commits?tab=readme-ov-file#automatically-validate-commit-message-convention-before-commit)

### pre-receive Hook (server side)
* create following file in your repository folder `.git/hooks/pre-receive`
  ```shell
  #!/usr/bin/env bash

  # Pre-receive hook that will block commits with messages that do not follow regex rule

  commit_msg_type_regex='feat|fix|refactor|style|test|docs|build'
  commit_msg_scope_regex='.{1,20}'
  commit_msg_description_regex='.{1,100}'
  commit_msg_regex="^(${commit_msg_type_regex})(\(${commit_msg_scope_regex}\))?: (${commit_msg_description_regex})\$"
  merge_msg_regex="^Merge branch '.+'\$"

  zero_commit="0000000000000000000000000000000000000000"

  # Do not traverse over commits that are already in the repository
  excludeExisting="--not --all"

  error=""
  while read oldrev newrev refname; do
    # branch or tag get deleted
    if [ "$newrev" = "$zero_commit" ]; then
      continue
    fi

    # Check for new branch or tag
    if [ "$oldrev" = "$zero_commit" ]; then
      rev_span=`git rev-list $newrev $excludeExisting`
    else
      rev_span=`git rev-list $oldrev..$newrev $excludeExisting`
    fi

    for commit in $rev_span; do
      commit_msg_header=$(git show -s --format=%s $commit)
      if ! [[ "$commit_msg_header" =~ (${commit_msg_regex})|(${merge_msg_regex}) ]]; then
        echo "$commit" >&2
        echo "ERROR: Invalid commit message format" >&2
        echo "$commit_msg_header" >&2
        error="true"
      fi
    done
  done

  if [ -n "$error" ]; then
    exit 1
  fi
  ```
* ⚠ make `.git/hooks/pre-receive` executable (unix: `chmod +x '.git/hooks/pre-receive'`)
